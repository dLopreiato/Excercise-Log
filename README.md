# Exercise Log
Minimal logging software to keep track of my exercises, and workouts.

-----

### Configuration
Create a file called "server_variables.php" inside the lib direction and past this in:

```php
<?php

// will force TLS on every page if set to true
define('FORCE_TLS', FALSE);

// database connection credentials
define('MYSQL_HOST', '');
define('MYSQL_USER', '');
define('MYSQL_PASS', '');
define('MYSQL_DBNAME', 'exercise_log');
?>

```

### Contributions
I'll accept contributions so long as they are in the spirit of the program, and they make sense.
